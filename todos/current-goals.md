# 🚀 That Smart Site — Core Development Roadmap

## 🧩️ 1. Onboarding & Provisioning (**COMPLETE**)
✅ Signup form → Stripe checkout → provisioning job → subdomain + SSL → welcome email → first-login dashboard  
✅ Add fallback "default content" logic — every new site boots with industry defaults (no empty pages)  
✅ Implement Stripe webhook for tenant activation  
✅ Include post-provision confirmation screen + "View my site" button  
✅ Validate full run: business info → pay → live `[slug].thatsmartsite.com` → dashboard login  

    ✅ Welcome email
    • SendGrid email service integrated
    • Welcome email template with login credentials
    • Automated email sending after successful payment
    • Sends to both personal and business emails (if different)
    • Test email endpoint for development
    ❌ SSL (automatic)
    • No automatic SSL certificate provisioning
    • SSL is handled at the hosting/CDN level, not in the application
    ✅ First-login to dashboard
    • Success page now has "Go to Dashboard" button
    • Automatically logs user in with temp password
    • Redirects to /{slug}/dashboard after successful login

**Acceptance:** I can paste a business’s info, pay, and get a live site + dashboard.

## 🌐 2. SEO Foundation
✅ Implement per-tenant `robots.txt`  
✅ Auto-generate `sitemap.xml` per tenant  
✅ Add canonical + noindex for previews  
✅ Create centralized JSON-LD helpers (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ)  
❌ SEO audit: Lighthouse SEO ≥ 90  

**Acceptance:** Tenant pages emit valid canonical + JSON-LD, `/robots.txt` + `/sitemap.xml` resolve.

---

## 🎗️ 3. Multi-Tenant Routing & Config Loader
✅ Detect subdomain/custom domain (basic router scaffold exists)  
✅ Load `{industry, theme, city/service pages}` from DB  
✅ Fallback to `/data/<industry>.json` when DB empty  
✅ Swap entire branding/config when switching subdomains  
❌ Verify preview vs live domain logic  

**Acceptance:** Switching subdomains fully swaps branding, services, and locations without code changes.

---

## 🗕️ 4. Booking System (Tier 2/3 Feature)
✅ Define schema: Services → Time Slots → Bookings (tables exist but flow unimplemented)  
❌ Generate time slots from business hours  
✅ Create booking from public site  
❌ Send confirmation emails (tenant + client)  
✅ Record booking in `booking.bookings`  

**Acceptance:** From public site, a client can select service → time → book → record saved.

---

## ⭐ 5. Reviews Ingestion & Display v1
✅ Database schema ready (`reputation.reviews`)  
❌ Mock nightly job or API pull  
✅ Dashboard moderation toggle ("Approved")  
✅ Display reviews on homepage + /reviews  
✅ Include structured Review schema markup  

**Acceptance:** Reviews render on site with SEO data and can be toggled visible via dashboard.

---

## 🧯 6. Tenant Dashboard — Minimal CMS
✅ Skeleton dashboard in progress  
✅ "Business Profile" section (editable fields)  
✅ "Services & Tiers" management  
✅ "Service Areas & Hours" modules  
✅ "Theme" customization (logo/colors)  
✅ "Reviews Moderation" tab  
❌ Mark default vs customized fields; include "Reset to Default"  

**Acceptance:** Tenant can replace default text/images through dashboard.

---

## ⚙️ 7. Quality Gates & Ops
✅ Feature-boundary lint rule (`check-import-boundaries.ts`)  
✅ Strict TypeScript config  
✅ Add unit test coverage for hooks/utils  
❌ Create seed script: one demo tenant per industry  
✅ Scheduled Lighthouse/health check → write to `system.health_monitoring`  
❌ Ensure CI blocks rule violations  

**Acceptance:** Local build can spin demo tenant; CI + nightly checks pass cleanly.

---

## 🎯 8. Launch Readiness Checklist
✅ Verify default emails (welcome, booking, review invite)  
✅ Add SEO meta defaults (title, description, OG)  
✅ Add Lighthouse + SSL verification script  
❌ Final test with demo tenant → real subdomain → Stripe live mode  

**Acceptance:** Demo tenant behaves like a real tenant with fully working SEO, booking, and dashboard.
