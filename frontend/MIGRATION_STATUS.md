# Migration Status: Pages → Features

## ✅ COMPLETED MIGRATIONS

All pages have been successfully migrated to the features-based architecture:

| Pages Directory | Features Directory | Status |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| `pages/adminDashboard` | `features/adminDashboard` | ✅ Complete |
| `pages/affiliateDashboard` | `features/affiliateDashboard` | ✅ Complete |
| `pages/affiliateOnboarding` | `features/affiliateOnboarding` | ✅ Complete |
| `pages/booking` | `features/booking` | ✅ Complete |
| `pages/home` | `features/home` + individual features | ✅ Complete |
| `pages/serviceSection` | `features/services` | ✅ Complete |

## 🚫 DEPRECATED: Pages Directory

The `src/pages/` directory is now **DEPRECATED** and should not be used for new development.

### Why Pages Directory is Deprecated

1. **Feature-based Architecture**: All functionality has been moved to `features/` for better organization
2. **Better Modularity**: Features are self-contained with their own components, hooks, APIs, and types
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify related code
4. **Consistent Imports**: All imports now use the `@` alias pointing to features

### What to Use Instead

❌ **Don't use:**
```typescript
import { SomeComponent } from '@/pages/somePage/components/SomeComponent';
import { SomeHook } from '@/pages/somePage/hooks/useSomeHook';
```

✅ **Use instead:**
```typescript
import { SomeComponent } from '@/features/someFeature/components/SomeComponent';
import { SomeHook } from '@/features/someFeature/hooks/useSomeHook';
```

## 🔧 Tools to Enforce Migration

### 1. ESLint Rules
The ESLint configuration now prevents imports from the pages directory:
```bash
npm run lint:pages
```

### 2. Migration Check Script
Check for any remaining pages directory usage:
```bash
npm run check-pages
```

### 3. IDE Warnings
The pages directory files now have `@deprecated` comments that will show warnings in your IDE.

## 🧹 Cleanup Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Add deprecation warnings (✅ Complete)
2. **Phase 2**: Monitor usage with ESLint and scripts (✅ Complete)
3. **Phase 3**: Remove pages directory after confirming no usage (Future)

## 🚀 Benefits of Features Architecture

- **Self-contained**: Each feature has its own components, hooks, APIs, and types
- **Reusable**: Features can be easily imported and used across the app
- **Maintainable**: Related code is grouped together
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new features without cluttering
- **Testable**: Features can be tested in isolation

**Note**: If you find any code still importing from `@/pages/`, please update it to use `@/features/` instead.
