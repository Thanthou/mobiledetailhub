## Guidelines

### When to use `features-wip/`
- âœ… Feature code is complete and tested
- âœ… Waiting for external dependencies (API, design, etc.)
- âœ… Ready to wire into routes within 1-2 months
- âœ… Code is production-quality

### Adding a WIP Feature
1. Create feature directory
2. Add README.md with status, owner, and integration plan
3. Build feature as if it were production-ready
4. List it in the table above

**Review Schedule:** Weekly check for integration readiness
