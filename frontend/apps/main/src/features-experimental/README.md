## Guidelines

### When to use `features-experimental/`
- âœ… Exploring new technologies or patterns
- âœ… Proof-of-concept for potential features
- âœ… Research spikes with uncertain outcomes
- âœ… Code quality can be lower (it's a learning exercise)

### Adding an Experimental Feature
1. Create feature directory
2. Add README.md with hypothesis and success criteria
3. Experiment freely - code quality is secondary
4. List it in the table above
5. Set a review date (typically 1-3 months)

**Review Schedule:** Quarterly reviews to promote, continue, or delete
