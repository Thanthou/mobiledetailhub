          "question": "Do you provide water and electricity?",
          "answer": "Yes! We bring our own water supply and generator, so we're completely self-contained. You don't need to provide anything."

      "items": [
        {
          "question": "What's included in a full detail?",
          "answer": "A full detail includes:\n- Exterior: Hand wash, clay bar treatment, paint decontamination, polish, sealant/wax\n- Interior: Vacuum, steam cleaning, leather conditioning, glass cleaning, trim dressing\n- Wheels: Deep cleaning, tire dressing, brake dust removal\n- Engine bay: Degreasing and dressing (if requested)"
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between ceramic coating and wax?",
          "answer": "Ceramic coating is a permanent, chemical bond that lasts years, provides superior protection, and makes cleaning easier. Traditional wax is a temporary sacrificial layer that lasts weeks to months. Ceramic coating costs more upfront but provides significantly better long-term value."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is paint correction necessary before ceramic coating?",
          "answer": "Paint correction removes scratches, swirl marks, and oxidation before coating. While not always required, it's highly recommended because ceramic coating locks in the current paint condition. Correcting the paint first ensures you get the best possible results."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is PPF and where should I apply it?",
          "answer": "Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a clear, self-healing urethane film that protects against rock chips and scratches.
