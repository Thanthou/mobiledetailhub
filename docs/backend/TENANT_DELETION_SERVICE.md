# Tenant Deletion Service - Task #3 Complete ✅

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Problem

The original tenant deletion system had three different code paths:
1. ⚠️ **Modern service-based deletion** - Good, but no dry-run capability
2. ⚠️ **Soft delete** - Good, keeps data but marks as deleted
3. ⚠️ **Legacy inline deletion** - 200+ lines of manual CASCADE logic that could diverge from database constraints

The legacy route was a maintenance nightmare:
- Manual ordered deletion across 13+ tables
- Risk of divergence from database CASCADE constraints
- No dry-run capability
- Hard to test and reason about
- Duplicated logic

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Dry-Run Capability ✅

**New Function** (`backend/services/tenantDeletionService.js`):
```javascript
export async function dryRunDeleteTenant(tenantId, actor) {
  // Analyzes what would be deleted WITHOUT actually deleting
  // Returns detailed report of all affected records
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Shows exact count of records in each table that would be deleted
- ✅ Runs full validation without side effects
- ✅ Provides recommendations (safe to delete vs requires force=true)
- ✅ Calculates total impact across all tables
- ✅ No transaction - completely read-only

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "dryRun": true,
  "summary": {
    "tenant": {
      "id": 123,
      "slug": "mobile-detailing-pro",
      "business_name": "Mobile Detailing Pro",
      "email": "owner@example.com",
      "status": "approved"
    },
    "validation": {
      "canDeleteSafely": false,
      "issues": [
        {
          "type": "active_subscription",
          "message": "Tenant has active subscription: Professional",
          "data": { "plan_name": "Professional", "status": "active" }
        }
      ]
    },
    "recordsToDelete": {
      "services": 8,
      "service_tiers": 24,
      "service_areas": 12,
      "subscriptions": 1,
      "bookings": 156,
      "quotes": 42,
      "availability": 365,
      "blackout_dates": 12,
      "time_blocks": 48,
      "blocked_days": 24,
      "appointments": 89,
      "schedule_settings": 1,
      "website_content": 1,
      "reviews": 34,
      "tenant_images": 67,
      "health_monitoring": 245,
      "analytics_events": 12453,
      "user_record": 1
    },
    "totalRecords": 13582,
    "impact": {
      "hasActiveSubscription": true,
      "hasPendingBookings": false,
      "hasRecentActivity": true
    },
    "recommendation": "Requires force=true flag due to validation issues"
  }
}
```

### 2. Replaced Legacy Route with 410 Gone ✅

**Before** (❌ Bad - 200+ lines):
```javascript
router.delete('/tenants/:id/legacy', ..., async (req, res) => {
  // Manual cascade across 13+ tables
  await client.query('DELETE FROM reputation.reviews WHERE tenant_slug = $1', [tenant.slug]);
  await client.query('DELETE FROM tenants.tenant_images WHERE tenant_slug = $1', [tenant.slug]);
  await client.query('DELETE FROM website.content WHERE business_id = $1', [id]);
  // ... 10 more manual deletions
  await client.query('DELETE FROM tenants.business WHERE id = $1', [id]);
});
```

**After** (✅ Good - helpful 410 response):
```javascript
router.delete('/tenants/:id/legacy', authenticateToken, requireAdmin, (req, res) => {
  res.status(410).json({
    error: 'This endpoint has been permanently removed',
    message: 'Use DELETE /api/admin/tenants/:id instead',
    documentation: {
      newEndpoint: '/api/admin/tenants/:id',
      supportedParams: {
        force: 'boolean - Force deletion despite validation issues',
        dryRun: 'boolean - Analyze what would be deleted'
      },
      examples: {
        normalDeletion: 'DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123',
        forceDeletion: 'DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123?force=true',
        dryRun: 'DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123?dryRun=true'
      }
    },
    migration: {
      reason: 'The legacy route contained inline cascade logic that could diverge from database constraints.',
      benefits: [
        'Database-enforced cascades prevent orphaned records',
        'Centralized business logic in tenantDeletionService',
        'Better validation and dry-run capabilities',
        'Improved audit logging',
        'Transaction safety with verification'
      ]
    }
  });
});
```

**Why 410 (Gone) instead of 404 (Not Found)?**
- 410 explicitly indicates the resource *existed* but is *permanently removed*
- Provides helpful migration information
- Prevents silent failures
- Better for API versioning

---

### 3. Enhanced Modern Deletion Route ✅

**Updated** (`backend/routes/admin.js`):
```javascript
router.delete('/tenants/:id', criticalAdminLimiter, authenticateToken, requireAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  const { force = false, dryRun = false } = req.query;
  
  const result = await deleteTenant(parseInt(id), req.user, { 
    force: force === 'true',
    dryRun: dryRun === 'true'
  });
  
  // Returns dry-run analysis OR actual deletion result
});
```

**Supported Modes**:
1. **Normal Deletion**: `DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123`
   - Validates tenant can be safely deleted
   - Fails if active subscription, pending bookings, or recent activity
   
2. **Force Deletion**: `DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123?force=true`
   - Bypasses validation
   - Deletes anyway (with warnings logged)
   
3. **Dry-Run**: `DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123?dryRun=true`
   - Shows what WOULD be deleted
   - No actual changes made
   - Perfect for pre-deletion audit

4. **Force + Dry-Run**: `DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123?dryRun=true&force=true`
   - Shows analysis as if force was enabled
   - Still no actual deletion

---

### 4. Database CASCADE DELETE Constraints ✅

**Migration**: `backend/migrations/2025-10-19_add_cascade_delete_constraints.sql`

**Tables with CASCADE DELETE**:
```sql
-- When tenants.business is deleted, these CASCADE automatically:
✅ tenants.services
✅ tenants.service_areas
✅ tenants.subscriptions
✅ booking.bookings
✅ booking.availability
✅ booking.blackout_dates
✅ schedule.time_blocks
✅ schedule.blocked_days
✅ schedule.appointments
✅ schedule.schedule_settings
✅ website.content
✅ system.health_monitoring (if business_id exists)
✅ reputation.reviews (if business_id exists)
✅ tenants.tenant_images (if business_id exists)

-- Service tiers CASCADE when services are deleted:
✅ tenants.service_tiers → tenants.services → tenants.business
```

**Manual Cleanup (Edge Cases)**:
```javascript
// Service handles these manually (no FK or uses slug):
- reputation.reviews WHERE tenant_slug = '...' AND business_id IS NULL
- tenants.tenant_images WHERE tenant_slug = '...'
- system.health_monitoring WHERE tenant_slug = '...'
- booking.quotes WHERE affiliate_id = ...
- auth.users WHERE id = tenant.user_id
```

## API Reference

### DELETE /api/admin/tenants/:id

**Description**: Delete tenant and all associated data (or analyze with dry-run)

**Auth**: Requires admin token + critical rate limiting

**Query Parameters**:
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `force` | boolean | false | Force deletion despite validation issues |
| `dryRun` | boolean | false | Analyze without actually deleting |

**Response Codes**:
- `200 OK` - Deletion successful (or dry-run analysis)
- `400 Bad Request` - Validation failed (without force=true)
- `401 Unauthorized` - Missing or invalid auth token
- `403 Forbidden` - User is not admin
- `404 Not Found` - Tenant not found
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Deletion failed

**Example Requests**:

```bash
# 1. Dry-run (safe preview)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123?dryRun=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# 2. Normal deletion (with validation)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

---

### DELETE /api/admin/tenants/:id/soft

**Description**: Soft delete tenant (mark as deleted, keep data)

**Auth**: Requires admin token + critical rate limiting

**What it does**:
- Sets `application_status = 'deleted'`
- Updates `updated_at` and `last_activity` timestamps
- **Does NOT delete any data**

---

### DELETE /api/admin/tenants/:id/legacy ⚠️ REMOVED

**Status**: `410 Gone` - Permanently removed

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "This endpoint has been permanently removed",
  "message": "Use DELETE /api/admin/tenants/:id instead",
  "documentation": { ... }
}
```

---

## Usage Examples

### 1. Safe Deletion Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# Step 1: Dry-run to see what would be deleted
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123?dryRun=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Review the output:
# - totalRecords: How many records will be deleted
# - validation.issues: Any blocking issues
# - recommendation: What to do next

# Step 2: If validation passes, delete
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# OR if validation failed but you still need to delete:
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123?force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

### 2. Emergency Deletion

```bash
# Force delete immediately (use with caution!)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123?force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

### 3. Temporary Disable

```bash
# Soft delete (can be restored later)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123/soft" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Migration Path

### For API Consumers

**If you were using** `/api/admin/tenants/:id/legacy`:

1. **Switch to**: `/api/admin/tenants/:id`
2. **No behavior change**: Same result, better implementation
3. **New features**: Add `?dryRun=true` for pre-deletion analysis

**Example Migration**:
```javascript
// OLD (will get 410 Gone)
DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123/legacy

// NEW (works the same)
DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123

// NEW (with safety check)
DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123?dryRun=true  // Check first
DELETE /api/admin/tenants/123              // Then delete
```

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# 1. Create a test tenant (via admin panel or API)
# ...

# 2. Test dry-run
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/TEST_ID?dryRun=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  | jq '.summary.totalRecords'

# 3. Test actual deletion
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/TEST_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# 4. Verify deletion
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/TEST_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
# Should return 404 Not Found

# 5. Test legacy route (should get 410)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/tenants/123/legacy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
# Should return 410 Gone with migration docs
```
