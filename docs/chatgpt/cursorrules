    "project": "That Smart Site (Multi-Tenant SaaS)",
    "description": "That Smart Site is a white-label SaaS platform that generates websites for local service businesses (detailing, lawn care, maid service, pet grooming, etc.). Each tenant gets their own live subdomain site, managed via a multi-app frontend (main-site, tenant-app, admin-app) and Node.js/Express backend. The goal is modularity, maintainability, and automated provisioning at scale.",
    "architecture": "frontend (3 separate React apps) + backend (Express + PostgreSQL, multi-tenant schemas)",
    "philosophy": [
      "Code should be clean, predictable, and testable.",
      "Each app must remain independent yet interoperable through shared modules.",
      "Side effects live in hooks or services; pure logic lives in utils.",
      "Frontend apps follow feature-first structure with strict import boundaries.",
      "Automation scripts (audits, deploys, etc.) follow consistent doc and output structure."
