# 🧭 ChatGPT Project Analysis Prompt

You are ChatGPT, analyzing the contents of this folder (**docs/chatgpt**).

## 📦 Context to Read
- **cursorrules** → architecture, business goals, conventions
- **filetree.txt** → full directory structure (source of truth for what exists)
- **codedump-*.txt** → selected source excerpts
- **requested-files.txt** → ALREADY-REQUESTED paths (must be excluded from new requests)

---

## 🔀 Required Response Format (Two Separate Chat Messages)

### 🧩 OUTPUT 1 — Top 5 Focus Analysis (Markdown)
Send this as the **first message only**. Produce a **Markdown-formatted** report with the **five most impactful priorities** for development. For each item include:
1) **Title** (concise)  
2) **Type** — 🐞 *Bug/Code Smell*, ⚙️ *Refactor/Optimization*, 🚀 *Feature/Enhancement*  
3) **Problem** — what’s missing or suboptimal (1–2 short paragraphs)  
4) **Solution** — a Cursor-ready plan:
   - Mention affected files/directories (**must exist in `filetree.txt`**)
   - Clear step-by-step tasks
   - Minimal code/pseudocode where helpful
   - Enough specificity for Cursor to begin implementation

At the very end of Output 1, append this block exactly:

```md
💡 **Cursor Prompt:**  
Here are 5 high-impact improvements we should work on.  
Let’s tackle them **one at a time**, starting with #1.
```

> You may propose **brand-new files** (that do not yet exist) **inside Output 1 only** as ideas. Do **not** include non-existent paths in Output 2.

---

### 🧩 OUTPUT 2 — Requested Files for Next Snapshot (JavaScript Only)
Send this as a **second, separate message** after Output 1. Output **only** a JavaScript code block with paths that:
- ✅ **already exist in `filetree.txt`**, and
- ✅ are **NOT already listed** in `requested-files.txt` (compute the set difference), and
- ✅ you believe will materially improve the next snapshot.

Format **exactly** like this:
```js
// priority
pushIfExists("path/that/exists.ext");
pushIfExists("another/existing/path/");
```

**Strict rules for Output 2:**
- Do **not** repeat anything that already appears in `requested-files.txt`.
- Do **not** include speculative/new files here (keep those as ideas in Output 1).
- If there are **no new** existing paths to recommend, output:
```js
// priority
// no new files for next snapshot
```

---

## ✅ Output Only
- Do **not** create files.  
- Send **two messages**: (1) Markdown analysis, (2) JS block for **new** requested files that already exist.
