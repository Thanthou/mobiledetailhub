# 🧭 ChatGPT Project Analysis Prompt

You are ChatGPT, analyzing the contents of this folder (**docs/chatgpt**).

## 🎯 Your Mission
Review the following files to understand the current state of the project:
- **cursorrules** → explains architecture, business goals, and code conventions  
- **filetree.txt** → provides full directory structure  
- **codedump-*.txt** → contains selected source code excerpts  

Based on this context, produce **two separate outputs** in two chat messages:

---

### 🧩 OUTPUT 1 — Top 5 Focus Analysis (Markdown)
Create a detailed **Markdown-formatted** report listing the **five most impactful priorities** for development.

For each:
1. **Title** — concise and descriptive  
2. **Type** — 🐞 Bug / ⚙️ Refactor / 🚀 Feature  
3. **Problem** — what’s missing or suboptimal  
4. **Solution** — Cursor-friendly, actionable implementation plan (with enough context for Cursor to begin work)

At the very end, close with:

```md
💡 **Cursor Prompt:**  
Here are 5 high-impact improvements we should work on.  
Let’s tackle them **one at a time**, starting with #1.
```

---

### 🧩 OUTPUT 2 — Requested Files for Next Snapshot
After sending the Markdown report, send a **second message** with only this JavaScript code block:

```js
// priority
pushIfExists("...");
pushIfExists("...");
```

These paths should represent files or directories you want to see next time to deepen your understanding of the codebase.

---

## ✅ Output Only
Do **not** create new files.  
Output both responses (1️⃣ Markdown report, 2️⃣ JS block) directly to the console.
