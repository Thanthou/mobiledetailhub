# Multi-App Preview Router for Audits — Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Priority:** High-Impact Feature

---

## 📋 Overview

Successfully extended the SEO audit system to scan all three frontend apps (`main-site`, `tenant-app`, `admin-app`) simultaneously, providing comprehensive Lighthouse reports for each app with consolidated scoring and per-app analytics.

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:**
- `audit-seo.js` only scanned `/main-site/`
- Admin and tenant apps were never audited for SEO issues
- Missing critical meta tags and schema issues went undetected
- No visibility into dashboard and storefront SEO health

**After:**
- Single audit run scans all three apps automatically
- Individual Lighthouse reports saved per app
- Consolidated Markdown report with per-app sections
- Average scoring across all apps for overall health metric
- Detailed per-app findings with key audit results

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Multi-App Configuration

Added app configuration array at the top of `audit-seo.js`:

```javascript
const APPS = [
  { name: "main-site", path: "/main-site/", description: "Marketing & Onboarding" },
  { name: "tenant-app", path: "/tenant-app/", description: "Live Tenant Storefronts" },
  { name: "admin-app", path: "/admin-app/", description: "Tenant Dashboard" },
];
```

### Lighthouse Loop

Refactored `runLighthouseSEO()` to iterate over all apps:

```javascript
for (const app of APPS) {
  const url = `http://localhost:${port}${app.path}`;
  const reportPath = `docs/audits/lighthouse/${app.name}-seo.json`;
  
  // Run Lighthouse
  // Parse results
  // Store in results object
  results[app.name] = { score, data: json };
}

return results; // Object with per-app results
```

### Report Generation

Enhanced Markdown report generator with:
- **Overview table** with average Lighthouse score
- **Per-app table** showing scores for all three apps
- **Per-app sections** with detailed audit findings
- **Mobile-friendly**, **Meta descriptions**, **Crawlable links** checks
- **hreflang** and **Document title** validation
