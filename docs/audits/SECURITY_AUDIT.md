## ✅ All Checks Passed!

No issues found during this audit.

## Detailed Log


## JWT Configuration

✅ JWT_SECRET is configured
✅ JWT_REFRESH_SECRET is configured
✅ Access and refresh tokens use different secrets
✅ Access token TTL is 15m (secure)
✅ Refresh token TTL is 30d (reasonable)

## Refresh Token Rotation

✅ Refresh token rotation is implemented
✅ Token rotation logic is in refreshAccessToken function

## CSRF Protection

✅ CSRF protection middleware exists
✅ CSRF middleware imported in auth routes
✅ CSRF protection applied to /refresh endpoint

## Rate Limiting

✅ Rate limiter middleware exists
✅ /login has rate limiting (sensitiveAuthLimiter)
✅ /register has rate limiting (sensitiveAuthLimiter)
✅ /refresh has rate limiting (refreshTokenLimiter)
✅ /request-password-reset has rate limiting (authLimiter)
✅ All sensitive auth endpoints are rate-limited

## Cookie Security

✅ Cookies have httpOnly flag set
✅ Cookies have sameSite attribute set
✅ Secure flag enabled in production

## Hardcoded Secrets Scan

✅ No hardcoded secrets found (scanned 122 files)

## SQL Injection Prevention

✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities found (scanned 122 files)

## CORS Configuration

✅ CORS middleware is configured
✅ CORS has origin validation callback
✅ CORS allows credentials (required for cookies)

## Log Redaction

✅ Log redaction is configured
✅ All sensitive fields are redacted in logs

## Production Environment Safety

✅ Production fail-fast validation exists
✅ All critical secrets validated in production

## Password Security

✅ Using bcrypt for password hashing
✅ bcrypt salt rounds: 10 (secure)

## Recommendations

1. Ensure all JWT secrets are 32+ characters
2. Keep access token TTL at 15m for security
3. Implement refresh token rotation to prevent replay attacks
4. Apply CSRF protection to all state-changing endpoints
5. Use rate limiters on auth, refresh, and password reset routes
6. Set httpOnly, secure, and sameSite on all auth cookies
7. Never commit secrets to version control
8. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
9. Configure CORS with origin validation
10. Redact sensitive data in production logs
11. Use bcrypt with 10+ salt rounds for passwords
12. Fail fast in production if critical secrets are missing
