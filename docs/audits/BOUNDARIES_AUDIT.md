## Recommendations

1. Apps may depend on shared/ or bootstrap/, but never import from each other
2. Shared layer must remain pure - no imports from admin-app, tenant-app, or main-site
3. Bootstrap layer must remain pure - no imports from any app
4. Extract shared functionality to shared/ instead of duplicating across apps
5. Use shared/ui/ for common components
6. Use shared/hooks/ for common React hooks
7. Use shared/utils/ for pure utility functions
