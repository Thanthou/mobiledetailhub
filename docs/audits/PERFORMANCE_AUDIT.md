## Detailed Log


## Route Loading Strategy

‚úÖ Total routes: 3 (0 lazy, 3 eager)
‚úÖ Route loading strategy is efficient

## Bundle Sizes

‚úÖ Total bundle size: 1.29MB across 48 files
‚úÖ All bundles under 500KB threshold

## Recommendations

1. Use dynamic imports and lazy loading for large chunks
2. Convert non-critical routes to lazy-loaded with React.lazy()
3. Wrap lazy routes with <Suspense> for smoother UX
4. Refactor components over 500 lines into smaller, focused units
5. Use code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
6. Monitor bundle sizes during development: npm run build
7. Consider using React.memo() for expensive components
