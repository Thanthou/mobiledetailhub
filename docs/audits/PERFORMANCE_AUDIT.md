## Recommendations

1. Use dynamic imports and lazy loading for large chunks
2. Convert non-critical routes to lazy-loaded with React.lazy()
3. Wrap lazy routes with <Suspense> for smoother UX
4. Refactor components over 500 lines into smaller, focused units
5. Use code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
6. Monitor bundle sizes during development: npm run build
7. Consider using React.memo() for expensive components
