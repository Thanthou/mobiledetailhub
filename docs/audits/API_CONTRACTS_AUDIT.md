## Recommendations

1. Ensure all responses use standard format: { success: true/false, data: ..., message: ... }
2. Add request validation middleware to all POST/PUT/PATCH endpoints
3. Document API contracts in docs/api.md or OpenAPI spec
4. Use consistent HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
5. Add JSDoc comments to all controller functions
