# Tenant Onboarding Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Type:** Architecture Refactor  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

---

## Summary

Moved tenant onboarding from `@shared` to `@main` because it's exclusively a marketing feature (converting prospects into tenants).

---

## Why This Move?

### The Question
**Should tenant onboarding be in shared or main?**

### Analysis

**Who Uses Tenant Onboarding:**
- ✅ Main app (marketing site) - Prospects sign up to become tenants
- ❌ Admin app - Admins approve applications, don't onboard themselves
- ❌ Tenant app - Tenants already onboarded (that's how they got the subdomain!)

**Result:** Only ONE app uses it → Should NOT be in shared!

---

## Architectural Principle

### ✅ Shared Should Contain:
- UI components used by 2+ apps (buttons, inputs, modals)
- Utilities used everywhere (formatters, validators)
- Hooks used by multiple apps (useAuth, useConfig)
- Contexts used by multiple apps (AuthProvider)

### ❌ Shared Should NOT Contain:
- Features used by only 1 app ← **Tenant onboarding**
- Marketing-specific flows ← **Tenant onboarding**
- App-specific business logic ← **Tenant onboarding**

---

## What We Did

### 1. ✅ Deleted Admin-App Version (41 files)
**Path:** `frontend/apps/admin-app/src/components/tenantOnboarding/`  
**Reason:** Orphaned duplicate, never used in any route  
**Status:** Deleted  

---

### 2. ✅ Removed from Tenant-App
**Removed:**
- Route: `/tenant-onboarding` ❌ (customers don't onboard as tenants!)
- UserMenu link ❌ (confusing for customers)
- DevNavigation link ❌ (dev menu clutter)

**Why wrong:**
- Tenant sites are for their customers (book detailing, lawn care, etc.)
- Customers visiting `subdomain.thatsmartsite.com` don't become tenants
- Only prospects on main site become tenants

---

### 3. ✅ Moved from Shared to Main (32 files)

**From:** `frontend/src/shared/components/tenantOnboarding/`  
**To:** `frontend/apps/main/src/components/tenantOnboarding/`

## Correct Flow Now

### Prospect → Tenant Journey ✅

```
1. Visit thatsmartsite.com (main app)
   ↓
2. Click "Get Started" (rocket animation)
   ↓
3. Navigate to /signup (tenant onboarding)
   ↓
4. Fill out application form
   ↓
5. Submit application
   ↓
6. Admin approves via admin dashboard
   ↓
7. Tenant gets subdomain.thatsmartsite.com
   ↓
8. Tenant manages site via /admin (never sees onboarding again)
```

### What Each App Does Now ✅

**Main App (thatsmartsite.com):**
- Marketing homepage ✅
- Pricing page ✅
- **Tenant signup (/signup)** ✅ ← Onboarding lives here
- No login (marketing only)

**Tenant App (subdomain.thatsmartsite.com):**
- Customer-facing website ✅
- Booking flow (/booking) ✅
- Tenant dashboard (/admin) ✅
- No onboarding ✅ ← Removed (doesn't belong)

**Admin App (admin.thatsmartsite.com):**
- View tenant applications ✅
- Approve/reject tenants ✅
- System management ✅
- No onboarding ✅ ← Deleted (doesn't belong)

---

## Benefits

### 1. Clear Ownership ✅
- Tenant onboarding is a marketing feature
- Lives with other marketing features (pricing, demos)

- Feature lives where it's used
- No false impression of multi-app usage

### 3. Easier Maintenance ✅

### 4. Proper Boundaries ✅
- Main = Marketing (includes lead gen/signup)
- Tenant = Product (customer-facing)
- Admin = Platform management (approval workflow)

---

### ✅ Build Test
```bash
npm run build:main
```
**Result:** Success in 4.85s ✅

### ✅ File Count
- Deleted from admin-app: 41 files
