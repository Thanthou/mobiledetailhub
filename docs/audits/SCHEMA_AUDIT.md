## Detailed Log

✅ Database connection successful

## Schema Switching

✅ Current schema: public
✅ Available schemas (10): analytics, auth, booking, customers, public, reputation, schedule, system, tenants, website
✅ Switched to tenants → tenants
✅ Switched to website → website
✅ Switched to analytics → analytics

## Tenant Middleware Simulation

✅ localhost → public (correct)
✅ admin.localhost → tenants (correct)
✅ demo.localhost → tenants (correct)
✅ www.thatsmartsite.com → public (correct)
✅ example.thatsmartsite.com → tenants (correct)

## Schema Isolation

✅ Tenants schema accessible via search_path
✅ Search path isolation verified (website.content requires schema prefix)
✅ Cross-schema joins work as expected (multi-tenant design)

## Environment Configuration

✅ BASE_DOMAIN: thatsmartsite.com
✅ Database connection configured via individual parameters (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD)

---

## Recommendations

1. Ensure tenant middleware dynamically switches schemas based on subdomain
2. Add BASE_DOMAIN to .env for production routing
3. Test isolation between tenant schemas to prevent data leakage
4. Verify all expected schemas (tenants, website, analytics) exist
5. Monitor schema switching in production logs
