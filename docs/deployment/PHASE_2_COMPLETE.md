- Built main app entry point with tenant detection
- Configured Vite for unified app
- Set up providers and routing scaffolding
- Created WIP/experimental feature directories
- **Verified working at http://localhost:5175** ✅

### Bonus: Backend & Config Fixes ✅
- Converted 10+ backend routes from CommonJS to ESM
- Fixed database pool imports across codebase
- Fixed Vite alias configurations for all apps
- Updated dev scripts for new 2-app workflow

## 📊 Current State

### Directory Structure
```
frontend/apps/
├── main/          ✅ NEW - Working skeleton (Phase 2 complete)
├── admin-app/     ✅ Unchanged, working
├── tenant-app/    🟡 Still exists (delete in Phase 4)
└── main-site/     🟡 Still exists (delete in Phase 4)
```

### Dev Servers
```bash
npm run dev:all
# Starts:
- main app      (Port 5175)
- admin app     (Port 5176)
- backend       (Port 3001)

# Legacy (if needed during Phase 3):
npm run dev:all:legacy  # Includes tenant-app on 5177
```

## 🎯 What's Next: Phase 3

**Goal:** Merge components from `main-site/` and `tenant-app/` into `main/`

**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes

**Major Tasks:**
1. Create `modes/ShowcaseApp.tsx` (Tenant-0 marketing mode)
2. Create `modes/TenantSiteApp.tsx` (Tenant-N standard mode)
3. Merge shared components (Hero, Header, Footer)
4. Copy tenant-only components (Gallery, Reviews, Services, Booking)
5. Update all imports from old apps to new `@/main/`
6. Add feature flags for showcase vs tenant features
7. Test both modes work correctly

- Component audit in guide shows what to merge vs keep

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

Before starting Phase 3, verify Phase 2:

- [x] New `main/` directory exists with proper structure
- [x] `npm run dev:main` starts successfully
- [x] App loads at http://localhost:5175
- [x] Shows "Phase 2 Complete" placeholder
- [x] Tenant detection works (shows "Tenant ID: 0")
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Backend starts without CommonJS errors
- [x] All Vite aliases resolve correctly

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### Don't Delete Yet
Keep `main-site/` and `tenant-app/` directories until Phase 3 is complete. You'll need them as reference during component merge.

### Port Assignments
- **5175** - main app (new unified engine)
- **5176** - admin app (unchanged)
- **5177** - tenant-app (legacy, available if needed)
- **3001** - backend

### Import Patterns
Old apps still use old imports. Phase 3 will update all to:
```typescript
// New pattern (after Phase 3)
import { Hero } from '@/main/components/hero';
import { Gallery } from '@/main/components/gallery';
```

---

## 🚀 Starting Phase 3

When ready to continue:

1. **Read the guide:**
   ```bash
   code docs/deployment/MIGRATION_TO_MAIN_APP.md
   ```

2. **Start fresh shell:**
   Close all dev servers, restart clean

3. **Create a branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/merge-to-main-app
   ```

4. **Follow Phase 3 steps:**
   Component merge, testing, cleanup
